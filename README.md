# Save rs:lightTable Data to File

Saves the current `rs:lightTable` highlight data from your browser's localStorage as a downloadable plain text file. The filename includes the current date to help with versioning. If no data is found, the bookmarklet alerts you so you know there’s nothing to save.

## How to Use

1. Copy the **minified** bookmarklet code (`save-rs-lighttable-data.min.js`).
2. Create a new bookmark in your browser.
3. Paste the minified code into the bookmark’s URL/location field.
4. Click the bookmark to download the current `rs:lightTable` data as a `.txt` file.

## Notes

- This tool helps you create an external backup of your table highlight data for safe keeping or transfer.
- All operations happen client-side — your data never leaves your browser except as the downloaded file.
